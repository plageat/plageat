- 👋 Hi, I’m @plageat
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Linux, software package management, containers, image recognition, low-level system programming and many-many other things.
- 🌱 I’m always on a learning stage and will never stop to improve my skill set. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Python's OS level software.
- 📫 Reach me here or there. I am everywhere ;-)
